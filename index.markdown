### Chicago, IL
* Climate similar to Toronto, being on the shore of Lake Michigan. Not very windy. ("Windy City" nickname is from Chicago politics, not the weather)
* Lots of good info here: http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/index

#### Transportation
* CTA is really convenient. Unlike TTC, your transfer does not have to be in a continous direction of travel. You can take anything you like within the transfer window. (i.e. free roundtrip)
* If you take the train at 3 or 4am, then you are literally walking into the homeless' house. Try sit close to the train conductor and _always_ stay awake. 
* Beware of Ventra double-charging. Ventra uses standard RFID technology as your credit card, so your transit fare may be charged to the wrong card if you slap your entire wallet on the machine. 
* Metra is commuter rail, often only run during weekday rush hours (like most GO Trains). It's also more expensive than CTA. 
* Pace is the regional bus service that goes to the subrubs.
* Divvy is the bike-sharing program, like Toronto's Bixi

#### Food
* Near North Side has a lot of food options. Although a lot of them are fancy restaurants, there are also many affodable ones. Giordano's, Portillo's, and XXX were wonderful.
* There are a lot of good restaurants in Chinatown. Take the Red line to Cermak-Chinatown. Along S Archer Ave, you will find Joy Yee's oversized Pho, and Ming-Shun's kickass dim sum. There are too many good ones to list here.
* Take the Pink Line to 18th (Pilsen) and you will find great Hispanic food. 

#### Safety
* Many areas of the city are not safe. Always be aware of your surroundings.
