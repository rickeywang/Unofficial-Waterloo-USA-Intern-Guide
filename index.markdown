### Getting your SSN
Ensure your full name is on the mailbox that the SS card will be delivered to. If your full name is not on the mailbox, USPS will return your SS card back to the Social Security Administration processing centre to be shredded. 

### Smartphones
To save money on various taxes for his pre-paid T-Mobile plan, Rickey used [CallingMart](http://www.callingmart.com/).

<section id="Area-Chicago-IL" />
### Chicago, IL
* Welcome to the Midwest! Chicago is the only city that matters around here.
* Climate similar to Toronto, being on the shore of Lake Michigan. Not very windy. ("Windy City" nickname is from politics, not weather)
* Lots of good info on [r/chicago](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/index)
* Avoid Jackson SSN office like the plague. Go to the one on 1233 W Adams instead. 


#### Transportation
* CTA is really convenient. Unlike TTC, your transfer does not have to be in a continous direction of travel. You can take anything you like within the transfer window (i.e. free roundtrip).
* If you take the train at 3 or 4am, then you are literally walking into the homeless' house. Try sit close to the train conductor and _always_ stay awake. 
* Beware of Ventra double-charging. Ventra uses standard RFID technology as your credit card, so your transit fare may be charged to the wrong card if you slap your entire wallet on the machine. 
* Metra is commuter rail, often only run during weekday rush hours (like most GO Trains). It's also more expensive than CTA. 
* Pace is the regional bus service that goes to the subrubs.
* Divvy is the bike-sharing program, like Toronto's Bixi.

#### Food
* Near North Side has a lot of food options. Although a lot of them are fancy restaurants, there are also many affodable ones. Giordano's and Portillo's were wonderful.
* There are a lot of good restaurants in Chinatown. Take the Red line to Cermak-Chinatown. Along S Archer Ave, you will find Lao Sze Chuan's real Fuqi feipian, and Ming-Shun's kickass dim sum. There are too many good ones to list here.
* Around Millenium Park, there is Wildberry for good brunch and Mariano's for cheap (relative to the loop) food.
* Good Vietnamnese food in Uptown / Argyle area.
* Take the Pink Line to 18th (Pilsen) to eat great Hispanic/Mexican food. (Do not go after dark)

#### Safety
* Some areas of the city are not safe. Always be aware of your surroundings, and take appropriate measurements to protect yourself. Use common sense.
* Crime data is available on [Chicago Tribune](http://crime.chicagotribune.com/) and [Chicago Police Department](http://gis.chicagopolice.org/clearmap_crime_sums/startpage.htm). 

##### Avoid:
* West of Wstern Avenue if you are south of North Ave. 
* South of 31st (Lakefront during the day, Hyde Park/Jackson Park, IIT, uChicago, and Cellular Field are OK. Take Jackson Park Express to Hyde Park area). Despite claims that Bronzeville is gentrifying, it is still quite sketchy.
* CTA trains south of Roosevelt or Cermak-Chinatown, __especially__ at night. 

#### Housing
* The usual websites will do. If you speak Chinese, check out [CSSA-IIT](http://www.cssa-iit.org/) or [Chinese of Chicago](http://bbs.chineseofchicago.com/) for housing. Most are near Chinatown, IIT, UIC, or Loyola.
* Try to target your research on the North and North West of Chicago, for safety reasons. Stay close to the 'L'. Here are some nice neighbourhoods you'd want to stay in:
<pre>
*Lincoln Park
*Bucktown
*Wicker Park (Not West Wicker Park)
*Ukrainian Village
*East Village
*Noble Square
*Logan Square
*Near North Side (Expensive) 
*South Loop 
*Lakeview
</pre>
* The price for a rent in those neighbourhoods is between 500$ and a 1000$/month, for a shared apartment with your own room. Normally the rooms are not furnished, so always ask details. 
* Also, in every case, you will have to pay two rents the first month, one for your rent and one for the deposit. 
* Demographic data is available on [NYTimes](http://projects.nytimes.com/census/2010/explorer).

#### Activities
* Many events throughout the year. Check reddit, yelp, timeout, etc...
* Lakefront trail is beautiful. 
* Lots of parks near the lake that you can explore.
* Wicker Park is hipster central. Boystown is gay people zone, also very hipster. 
* Bunch of theatres.
* Amazing architecture everywhere, many Frank Lloyd Wright buildings here
* Museums are everywhere as well. Make sure you give them your Chicago ZIP code, and ask for Chicago resident discount. The biggest ones are Museum of Science & Industry, Art Institute, and Field Museum. (Note to Torontonians: ROM is bigger than Field Museum)
